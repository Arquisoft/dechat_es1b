== Deployment View

DeChat is a client side application that will be run inside the user's browser without server intervention other than connecting to the SOLID PODs.

It makes sense to deploy the app in https://pages.github.com/[Github Pages]. 

This has the added benefit of having the whole project in one place so the user can see the code, the documentation and use the app itself from the same place.
