=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The main functionality consists of a decentralized, SOLID based 
chat application that allows to comunicate via text messages, and where users 
can share pictures, videos or other kind of files. Being decentralized, data 
storage will be separated from the app, and users will store their data 
on their own PODs.

.Motivation
Main motivation is keeping the user's privacy while chatting. None of
their chat data or files will be kept outside their respective user PODs, and
so they will have total control over their personal information and data.

.Form
* Users will receive a notification when another user wants to chat.
* Group chats, with multiple users receiving messages.
* Optionally, users will be able to share their screen.
* Optionally, users could perform live voice or video calls.
