## Architectural decisions

### Using JavaScript:

.Problem:
We have to choose the language of the programming that we will use to carry out the project, taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of each one.

.Constraints
We have to use Solid,  a web decentralization project led by Tim Berners-Lee.

.Assumptions
- If we use a language that we do not know at all, the beginning of the project will be hard.
- If we use a language other than JavaScript, we will have many less alternatives in the future because solid supports Angular a framework of JavaScript and React a library of JavaScript.

.Considered Alternatives
- Using Java.
- Using JavaScript.
- Using C#.

.Decision
We make the decisi√≥n of use JavaScript, because although we handle better in Java or C# we prefer take the risk of use use a programming language that we have used less but that provides us more resources in Solid.
