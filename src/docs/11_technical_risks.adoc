****
These are the known risks and solution proposals:
* *First time using several techs.* This project is the first time all of us work with Node.js and Angular. A such we will have to invest heavily in our formation.
* *New technology.* Solid is a relatively new spec, therefore it's not as tried and tested as a decades old tech would be. Nonetheless there should be enough resources online to solve most of our possible blocks and walls.
